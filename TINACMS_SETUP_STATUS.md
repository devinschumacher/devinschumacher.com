## 🚀 Current Status

**The CMS is fully functional for local development!**

You can:

- ✅ Create new blog posts with visual editor
- ✅ Edit existing posts
- ✅ Upload images
- ✅ All changes save to local markdown files

## 📝 Known Issues

1. **Search indexing**: Temporarily disabled due to a field mapping issue
   - Can be re-enabled once we fix the field types
   
2. **Static Export**: Currently disabled for CMS to work
   - Will need to be re-enabled for production static hosting
   - Or consider using server-side rendering for admin routes

npm run dev

# Access CMS
