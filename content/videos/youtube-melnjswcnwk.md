Open Vimeo Video: Start by locating the Vimeo video you want to download.\n2. Use DevTools: Right-click on the page and select \"Inspect\". Use Command/Control + F to search for \"player.vimeo\" in the HTML. Look for a link with a video ID.\n3. Copy Video URL: Double-click the desired URL, copy it, and paste it in your browser to isolate the video.\n4. Install Streamlink: Open your terminal and use the command `brew install Streamlink` (for Mac/Linux users with Homebrew installed).\n5. Construct Command: Use Streamlink with the video URL, specify the resolution (e.g., \"best\"), and define the output path (e.g., Desktop).\n6. Download the Video: Run the command, and Streamlink will download the Vimeo video to your specified location.\n\n\n\n-------------------- UPDATE --------------------\n\nI have successfully figured out how to download private vimeo videos as well.\n\nI also have a fix to anyone getting videos with \"no sound\"\n\nI will be releasing this fix soon.\n\nI'm still pretty new to coding so this took me quite a bit of time to get right.\n\nHERE IS A LINK TO THE BETA VERSION: https://serp.ly/stuff/vimeo-video-downloader\n\nThere my be bugs. If there are any issues, please report an issue here: https://github.com/serpcompany/extension-vimeo-video-downloader/issues\n\n-------------------- UPDATE #2 --------------------\n\nMany people have been asking for an easier method so I built an extension to do most of it for you, and the next release is going to be almost fully automated!\n\nIf youre looking for an easier way, you can get it here: https://serp.ly/stuff/vimeo-video-downloader\n\n\U0001F4FA Download Vimeo Videos with Browser Extension\n\U0001F517 https://serp.ly/stuff/vimeo-video-downloader\n\n\n\n---\nTAGS:\n\n#DownloadVimeoVideos  \n#VimeoVideoDownloader  \n#HowToDownloadVimeoVideosWithoutTools  \n#DownloadVimeoVideosMac  \n#StreamlinkTutorial  \n#HomebrewStreamlink  \n#VimeoVideoDownloadGuide  \n#VimeoVideoDownloaderMacLinux  \n#VimeoDevToolsTutorial  \n#CommandLineVideoDownload  \n#DownloadDisabledVimeoVideos  \n#VimeoVideoSaveTrick  \n#HowToDownloadFromVimeo  \n#DownloadVimeoVideoWithURL  \n#StreamlinkVimeoGuide"
