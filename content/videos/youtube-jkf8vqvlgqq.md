That’s why I made the SERP Vimeo Video Downloader.\n\nThis extension uses Streamlink to help you pull down any Vimeo video you're watching. Just load the extension manually into Chrome, click a button, copy the terminal command it generates, and you're good to go. Works for public and (most) private videos!\n\nTLDR: \nThis Chrome extension makes downloading Vimeo videos (even private ones) incredibly easy. No sketchy online tools. No confusing terminal commands. Just click, copy, and paste.\n\nGet it here: \U0001F517 https://serp.ly/vimeo-video-downloader\n\n----\n\nI am trying my best to respond to everyone on YouTube but its not an ideal place to help you troubleshoot things. \n\nSo, I am working on figuring out better solutions, for now I will just give you multiple ways to contact me in case you get stuck. \n\nOnce I get more organized life will be better for us all :)\n\n\U0001F41B Submit bugs here: https://serp.ly/video-downloader-extension-issues\n\U0001F4AC SERP Community (NEW): https://serp.ly/@serp/community\n\U0001F4AC SERP Discord: https://serp.ly/@serp/discord\n\n\n\n---\nSTEPS:\n\n1. Get the extension\n2. Unzip it if needed.\n3. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions\n4. Click \"Load unpacked\" and select the extension folder.\n5. Go to any Vimeo video page (public or private).\n6. Click the extension icon — it will detect the video and generate a terminal command.\n7. Copy the command and paste it in your terminal (you need Streamlink installed).\n8. Done! Your video should begin downloading.\n\nNeed Streamlink?\n- On Mac: Install via Homebrew by running `brew install streamlink`\n\nHaving issues?\nSubmit a bug or request via GitHub issues (link in the extension folder).\n\n\n---\nCHAPTERS:\n\n00:00 - Intro & What This Video Covers  \n00:28 - Why I Created the Extension  \n01:10 - How to Load the Extension in Chrome  \n02:00 - Using the Extension on a Vimeo Video Page  \n03:05 - Copying the Terminal Download Command  \n03:45 - Installing Streamlink (Mac via Homebrew)  \n04:25 - Downloading the Vimeo Video  \n05:10 - Notes on Private Video Support  \n06:00 - Debug Tips & Where to Report Issues  \n06:30 - Final Thoughts & Download Link Recap  \n\n\n---\nTAGS:\n\n#DownloadVimeoVideos\n#VimeoDownloaderExtension\n#DownloadPrivateVimeoVideo\n#VimeoVideoDownload2025\n#StreamlinkVimeo\n#ChromeExtensionVimeoDownloader\n#HowToDownloadVimeoVideos\n#VimeoDownloaderForChrome\n#FreeVimeoDownloader\n#DownloadVimeoWithSound\n#VimeoPrivateVideoDownloader\n#DownloadVimeoUsingStreamlink\n#SERPVimeoDownloader\n#VimeoVideoRipTool\n#DownloadVimeoVideosChrome\n\nTags Commas:"
