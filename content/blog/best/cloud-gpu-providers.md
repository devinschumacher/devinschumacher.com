Whether your company is involved in 3D visualization, machine learning, artificial intelligence, or any other type of heavy computing, your GPU computing strategy is critical.

Deep learning models used to take a long time to train and compute in businesses. As a result, their productivity suffered because it took up a lot of their time, was expensive, and left them with storage and space issues.

The latest generation of GPUs addresses this issue. They can handle large calculations and accelerate the training of your AI models due to their excellent parallel processing efficiency.

GPUs can train neural networks connected to deep learning 250 times faster than CPUs - and a new generation of cloud GPUs is transforming data science and other emerging technologies by providing even higher performance at a lower cost while allowing for easy scalability and rapid deployment.

This post will introduce you to cloud GPU concepts, how they relate to AI, ML, and deep learning, and some of the best cloud GPU platforms for deploying your preferred cloud GPU.

## What are Cloud GPUs?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devinschumacher/uploads/main/images/cloud-GPU-providers-1.jpg)

To better understand a cloud GPU, let's first talk about GPUs.

GPUs are specialized electronic circuitry that can rapidly alter and manipulate memory so that images and graphics can be created at a much faster rate.

It is because of their parallel structure that modern graphics processing units are more efficient at manipulating images and computer graphics than traditional CPUs (CPUs). A GPU may be found on the PC's motherboard, video card, or even the CPU die.

Cloud Graphics Units (GPUs), which are computer instances with powerful hardware acceleration, can be used to perform enormous AI and deep learning tasks in the cloud. It is not necessary to have a GPU installed on your computer to use this feature.

AMD, NVIDIA, Radeon, and GeForce are just some of the popular GPU brands.

### GPU Strengths

#### Scalability

If you wish to grow your company, the burden will inevitably increase. You'll need a GPU that can keep up with the additional workload. Cloud GPUs can assist you with this by allowing you to easily add extra GPUs without any problems in order to handle your rising demands. If you wish to scale down, you may do it quickly as well.

#### Cost

Instead of purchasing high-powered hardware GPUs, which are extremely expensive, you can rent cloud GPUs on an hourly basis for a lesser cost. You will be charged for the amount of hours you used the cloud GPUs, as opposed to the physical ones, which would have cost you a lot even if you didn't use them much.

#### "OPR" Other People's Resources

You've heard of "OPM", but how about "OPR"?

Cloud GPUs do not utilize your local resources, unlike real GPUs, which take up a lot of space on your PC. Furthermore, running a large-scale ML model or rendering a job slows down your machine.

You might consider outsourcing the processing power to the cloud to avoid taxing your computer and allowing it to be used with comfort. Simply utilize the computer to control everything rather than putting all of the strain and computational responsibilities on it.

### The role of GPUs in AI / ML / DL

Artificial intelligence is built on deep learning. It is a sophisticated ML approach that emphasizes representational learning using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Deep learning models are used to process massive datasets or computationally intensive procedures.

_So, how do GPUs come into play?_

GPUs are intended to execute parallel computations or many calculations at the same time. GPUs can use the deep learning model's capabilities to accelerate big computational workloads.

GPUs provide great parallel processing capabilities due to their multiple cores. Furthermore, they have increased memory bandwidth to support enormous volumes of data for deep learning systems. As a result, they are commonly used for training AI models, generating CAD models, and playing graphics-intensive video games, among other things.

Furthermore, if you wish to test various algorithms at the same time, you may use multiple GPUs. It allows various processes to run on separate GPUs without parallelism. To distribute massive data models, you can employ many GPUs across separate physical computers or on a single system.

### A few examples of how GPUs are utilized

- AI and ML are being used for picture recognition in AI.

- Computer images and CAD [designs that use 3D computer graphics](https://devinschumacher.com/graphic-design-tools/).

- Rendering polygons with texture mapping.

- Translation and rotation of vertices in a coordinate system, for example,

- Textures and vertices may now be modified through the use of programmable shaders.

- Video streaming, encoding, and decoding on the GPU

- Cloud-based and high-quality video games.

- Analytical and deep learning applications that demand general-purpose GPUs to handle large amounts of data in a scalable manner.

- All aspects of the production process from filming to creating content.

### But where to begin...?

It is not difficult to get started with cloud GPUs. In reality, once you grasp the fundamentals, everything becomes simple and quick. First and foremost, you must select a cloud GPU provider, such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Sign up for GCP next. All of the typical features are available here, such as cloud functions, storage choices, database administration, interaction with apps, and more. You may also utilize their Google Colboratory, which is similarly to Jupyter Notebook, to use one GPU for free. Finally, you can begin rendering GPUs for your application.

So, let's have a look at the various cloud GPU solutions for AI and large workloads.

## Run.ai

The Atlas platform from Run:ai enables users to virtualize and orchestrate their AI workloads, with a focus on optimizing GPU resources whether on-premises or in the cloud. It abstracts all of this hardware away, allowing developers to interact with the pooled resources using standard tools like Jupyter notebooks and IT teams to gain a better understanding of how these resources are used.

Based in Tel Aviv Run:ai, a startup that helps developers and operations teams manage and optimize their AI infrastructure, announced today a $75 million Series C funding round led by Tiger Global Management and Insight Partners, who also led the company's $30 million Series B round in 2021. This round also included previous investors TLV Partners and S Capital VC, bringing Run:total ai's funding to $118 million.

The new round comes at a time when the company is rapidly expanding. According to the company, its annual recurring revenue has increased 9x in the last year, while its staff has more than tripled. Run:ai CEO Omri Geller attributes this to a variety of factors, including the company's ability to build a global partner network to accelerate growth and the overall enterprise momentum for the technology.

"As organizations move beyond the incubation stage and begin scaling their AI initiatives, they are unable to meet the expected rate of AI innovation due to severe challenges managing their AI infrastructure," he explained.

## CoreWeave

CoreWeave can be used to deploy artificial intelligence applications and machine learning models by data scientists, machine learning engineers, and software engineers, to name a few roles. Clients can also manage their complex AI solutions powered by GPUs with the help of CoreWeave's specialized DevOps expertise, according to the company.

CoreWeave, a specialized [cloud services](https://devinschumacher.com/best/cloud-storage-services/) provider for GPU-based workloads, announced a collaboration with GPU giant Nvidia to help businesses scale their infrastructure, reduce costs, and improve efficiencies.

This relatively new cloud services provider provides on-demand computing resources across several tech verticals and has stated that it will continue to improve performance with the help of a $50 million round of funding from Magnetar Capital.
