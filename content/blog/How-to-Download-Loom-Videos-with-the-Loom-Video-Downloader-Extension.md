## Understanding Permission Requirements - Security Transparency
</summary>
### Problem Solved: Video Extraction Capability  
This extension resolves the fundamental problem of accessing Loom videos when standard methods fail, providing single-click extraction from Loom's platform directly to your local storage for offline access and archival purposes.

### Permission Solution: File Transfer Capability

The "downloads" permission solves the core challenge of transferring video files from web sources to your local computer. Without this capability, the extension cannot fulfill its primary function of video preservation.

### Access Solution: Targeted Tab Interaction

The "activeTab" permission resolves privacy concerns by providing controlled access exclusively to your current browser tab and only when you explicitly activate the extension on Loom-compatible pages.

### Storage Solution: Preference Persistence

The "storage" permission addresses the issue of repeated configuration by maintaining your settings locally within browser storage, ensuring consistent operation across browsing sessions.

### Communication Solution: Status Updates

The "notifications" permission solves the problem of unclear download status by providing real-time updates for download initiation, successful completion, and error conditions requiring user attention.

### Interface Solution: Enhanced Accessibility

The "contextMenus" permission addresses workflow efficiency by integrating download options directly into browser right-click menus, providing alternative access methods for improved user experience.

### Input Solution: Streamlined URL Processing

The "clipboardRead" permission may resolve the challenge of manual URL entry by enabling direct video link processing from your system clipboard for enhanced workflow efficiency.

### Navigation Solution: Context Awareness

The "tabs" permission addresses the challenge of inappropriate extension activation by providing access to tab metadata, ensuring operation occurs only on relevant Loom video pages.

### Processing Solution: Advanced Video Detection

The "scripting" permission solves the problem of video discovery by enabling sophisticated content analysis scripts on Loom pages for reliable video element identification and extraction preparation.

### Performance Solution: Background Operations

The "offscreen" permission addresses the challenge of browser interference during downloads by enabling background video processing, ensuring seamless completion without disrupting your browsing activities.

### Authentication Solution: Account Integration

The "cookies" permission may resolve access issues with private or restricted video content by utilizing Loom platform authentication tokens when necessary for authorized video extraction.

### Monitoring Solution: Intelligent Feature Activation

The "webNavigation" permission addresses the challenge of manual activation by monitoring navigation to Loom video pages, enabling contextually appropriate feature presentation when most useful.

### Security Solution: Limited Domain Access

Permission scope is restricted exclusively to loom.com and associated subdomains, solving security concerns by preventing access to unrelated websites or personal information on other domains.

### Trust Solution: Local Code Execution Only

This extension solves security concerns about external code by operating with completely self-contained functionality - no remote script execution or external dependencies that could compromise your security or privacy.
